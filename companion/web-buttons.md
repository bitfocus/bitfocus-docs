# Show only specific pages
You can restrict which pages to show, if you for example want someone else to only control buttons on some pages. If you want to give someone the buttons for pages 10 and 11, you can give them the link to your companion like this: http://your-ip:8000/tablet.html?pages=10,11

As you can see by the url, after ?pages= you can list the pages you want to show.
