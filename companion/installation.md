### Raspberry PI (raspbian)

To be able to use Companion on the raspberry pi without running as root (it is not recomended to run companion as root), you need to add a udev rule.

These rules needs to be added in in a new file at **/etc/udev/rules.d/50-companion.rules** with the following content:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="input", GROUP="input", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0060", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
KERNEL=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0060", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="ffff", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1f40", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
KERNEL=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="ffff", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1f40", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
```

When you have done this, you can either reboot, or disconnect the devices and run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` before reconnecting them.

### Linux

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/releases) for linux, untar, run!

To be able to use Companion in Linux without running as root (it is not recomended to run companion as root), you need to add a udev rule.

These rules needs to be added in **/etc/udev/50-companion.rules** with the following content:

```

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0060", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
KERNEL=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0060", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
